## About Files

- Files store data on disk.
- They can be either text or binary files.
- Text files store text data in standard encodings that can be understood by
  many programs.
    - Often have name extensions that indicate the type of file, such as `.py`
      for Python scripts, `.csv` for comma-separated values data,
      and `.txt` for plain text files.
    - There are different encodings for text data that affect how the text is
      stored. Common encodings are ASCII and UTF-8. We will ignore encodings
      from here on.
- Binary files store binary data. Apart from conventions about the ordering of
  bytes on disk, binary files can have almost any internal structure.
    - There are some well documented binary file standards, such as PDF, and
      NetCDF.
    - However, frequently binary files can only be read by the software that
      created them.
- Python supports working with both binary and text files.
- We only explore working with text files here.

## Opening Files

To open a file, we use the `open()` function, which returns a file object:

~~~
my_file = open("my_data_file.txt", "r")
~~~
{: .language-python}

- The first argument is a string containing the filename.
- The second argument is the mode string describing the intended use.
  The mode can be:
    - `"r"` : the file will only be read (this is the default)
    - `"w"` : only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased)
    - `"a"` : for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end
    - `"r+"`: both reading and writing.
- Files are normally opened in text mode. By appending `"b"` to the mode,
  the file will be opened in binary mode.
- If the open succeeds, a file object will be returned.
- If the open fails, an exception will be raised.

## Closing Files

Files need to be closed when they are no longer needed. One reason is that
operating systems can lock files while they are open, to prevent unexpected
changes while the file is in use.

In Python, closing files is a simple call to the `close()` method on the file
object. You can check the status of a file with the `closed` property:

~~~
my_file = open("my_data_file.txt", "r")
# do some processing
print(my_file.closed)  # should print False
my_file.close()
print(my_file.closed)  # should print True
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Reading from a File

Recall that `open()` returns a file object after successfully opening a file. This
object can be used to read data from the file. The `readline()` method will be
most useful to us here. It reads a single line from the file. Repeated calls to
`readline()` will return subsequent lines in order until the end of the file is
reached. The newline character (`\n`) is left at the end of the string, and is
only omitted on the last line of the file. This means that the end of the file
is indicated when `readline()` returns an empty string. Blank lines in the file
are indicated by the string `"\n"`.

For reading lines from a file, you can iterate over the file object. This is memory efficient, fast, and leads to simple code:
~~~
for line in f:
    print(line)
~~~
{: .language-python}

> ## Update your text reading program to use file iteration
> Update your previous program to use the file iteration approach. You should
> see the same output.
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > f = open("a_few_lines_of_text.txt")
> > count = 0  # initialise the line count
> > for line in f:
> >     print(count, line)
> >     count = count + 1
> > f.close()
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Iterating a collection where both the data and the index (the line count in our
case) are required is a very common operation, and Python provides the
[`enumerate()`][enumerate-function] function
for just this purpose.

> ## Update your text reading program to use `enumerate`
> Update your previous program to use the `enumerate()` function. You should
> see the same output.
> > ## Solution

> > f = open("a_few_lines_of_text.txt")
> > for count, line in enumerate(f):
> >     print(count, line)
> > f.close()
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

## Writing to a File

Text can be written to a text file that has been opened for writing with the
`write()` method on the file object:
~~~
f = open("my_text.txt")
f.write("this is a line of text.\n")
f.close()
~~~
{: .language-python}

Note that `write()` does not add a newline to the end. If you want a newline or
carriage return, you need to add it yourself.

## Context Managers

The safest way to open files is to use the [`with`][with-statement] statement.
This causes your file to be automatically closed as soon as program
execution leaves the scope of the `with` statement. For example:
~~~
with open("a_file.txt", "w") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
~~~
{: .language-python}

In addition being simpler, this approach is also safer. The file will
always be closed, even when unexpected exceptions or other errors occur.

This leads us to a robust and useful pattern for sequentially processing every
line in a text file:
~~~
with open("a_file.txt", "w") as f:
    for line in f:
        # process the line
~~~
{: .language-python}

## Putting it all together
> ## Reading and writing different files at the same time
> In this exercise, write a Python program to read lines of text from
> `a_few_lines_of_text.txt`. For each line, write the line number followed by `": "`
> and then the input text to a separate file called "numbered_lines_of_text.txt".
> For example, if the third line of text is
> "this is the third line" then the third line of
> the new file would be "2: this is the third line".
>
> Your program should close both files when finished, including after any errors
> are encountered.
> > ## Solution
> > ~~~
> > with open("../data/a_few_lines_of_text.txt") as fin, open("numbered_lines_of_text.txt", "w") as fout:
> >     for count, line in enumerate(fin):
> >         fout.write("{0}: {1}".format(count, line))
> > ~~~
> > {: .language-python}
> {: .solution}
