This lesson is intended to follow on from our [Introduction to
Python][intro-to-python] lesson.  It is designed to be used in both [Data
Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}) and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }})
workshops.  This lesson assumes that you will be working from the command-line
with Python files and the Python interpreter.  The exercises could be completed
in other environments such as [Jupyter][jupyter] or an [IDE][python_ide], but
this may require some small adaptations to the exercises.

> ## Why Python 3?
>
> Please note that this lesson uses [Python 3][python3] rather than [Python
> 2][python2]. Support for Python 2 is due to end in 2020, and users are
> strongly urged to move to Python 3 as soon as possible. Given this, it makes
> sense that new users should start with Python 3. As an added bonus, this
> allows us to make use of some new features of Python 3.

> ## Prerequisites
>
>1. Learners need to have a basic familiarity with the command line. Specifically, you need to
>   understand:
>       1. what files and directories are,
>       2. what a working directory is,
>       3. how to edit a text file,
>       4. how to start a Python interpreter,
>       5. and how to execute Python files.
>
> 2. Learners must install Python before the class starts.
>
> 3. Learners must download the data before class starts:
>    please download and unzip the file
>    [introduction_to_python_data.zip]({{page.root}}/files/introduction_to_python_data.zip).
>
>    Please see [the setup instructions]({{ page.root }}/setup.html)
>    for details.
